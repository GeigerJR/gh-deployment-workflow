# GitHub Pages Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to automatically deploy a static website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

Whenever the `index.html` file is updated on the `main` branch, it triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the changes to GitHub Pages.

The deployed site will be available at:  
`https://<GeigerJR>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`
https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow
